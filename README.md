# S3Contents

A S3 and GCS backed ContentsManager implementation for Jupyter.

It aims to a be a transparent, drop-in replacement for Jupyter standard filesystem-backed storage system.
With this implementation of a Jupyter Contents Manager you can save all your notebooks, regular files, directories
structure directly to a S3/GCS bucket, this could be on AWS/GCP or a self hosted S3 API compatible like [minio](http://minio.io).

While there is some implementations of this functionality already available online [2] I wasn't able to make
them work in newer Jupyter Notebook installations. This aims to be a better tested one
by being highly based on the awesome [PGContents](https://github.com/quantopian/pgcontents)[1].

## Prerequisites

Write access (valid credentials) to an S3/GCS bucket, this could be on AWS/GCP or a self hosted S3 like [minio](http://minio.io).

## Installation

```
$ pip install s3contents
```

## Jupyter config

Edit `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` by filling the missing values:

### S3

```python
from s3contents import S3ContentsManager

c = get_config()

# Tell Jupyter to use S3ContentsManager for all storage.
c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = S3ContentsManager
c.S3ContentsManager.access_key_id = <AWS Access Key ID / IAM Access Key ID>
c.S3ContentsManager.secret_access_key = <AWS Secret Access Key / IAM Secret Access Key>
c.S3ContentsManager.bucket = "<bucket-name>>"
```

Example for `play.minio.io:9000`:

```python
from s3contents import S3ContentsManager

c = get_config()

# Tell Jupyter to use S3ContentsManager for all storage.
c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = S3ContentsManager
c.S3ContentsManager.access_key_id = "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F"
c.S3ContentsManager.secret_access_key = "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG"
c.S3ContentsManager.endpoint_url = "http://play.minio.io:9000"
c.S3ContentsManager.bucket = "s3contents-demo"
c.S3ContentsManager.prefix = "notebooks/test"
```

### GCP

Note that the file `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` assumes a posix system
when you did `gcloud init`

```python
from s3contents import GCSContentsManager

c = get_config(

c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = GCSContentsManager
c.GCSContentsManager.project = "<your-project>"
c.GCSContentsManager.token = "~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json"
c.GCSContentsManager.bucket = "<bucket-name>"
```

## AWS IAM

It is also possible to use IAM Role-based access to the S3 bucket from an Amazon EC2 instance; to do that,
just leave ```access_key_id``` and ```secret_access_key``` set to their default values (```None```), and ensure that
the EC2 instance has an IAM role which provides sufficient permissions for the bucket and the operations necessary.

## Access local files

To access local file as well as remote files in S3 you can use `pgcontents.`.

First: 
```
pip install pgcontents
```

And use a configuration like this:

```python
from s3contents import S3ContentsManager
from pgcontents.hybridmanager import HybridContentsManager
from IPython.html.services.contents.filemanager import FileContentsManager

c = get_config()

c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = HybridContentsManager

c.HybridContentsManager.manager_classes = {
    # Associate the root directory with a PostgresContentsManager.
    # This manager will receive all requests that don"t fall under any of the
    # other managers.
    "": S3ContentsManager,
    # Associate /directory with a FileContentsManager.
    "local_directory": FileContentsManager,
}

c.HybridContentsManager.manager_kwargs = {
    # Args for root PostgresContentsManager.
    "": {
        "access_key_id": "access-key",
        "secret_access_key": "secret-key",
        "endpoint_url": "http://localhost:9000",
        "bucket": "notebooks",
    },
    # Args for the FileContentsManager mapped to /directory
    "local_directory": {
        "root_dir": "/Users/drodriguez/Downloads",
    },
}
```
